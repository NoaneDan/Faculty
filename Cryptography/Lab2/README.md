#### How it works:
###### GCD using factorization
Decompose the numbers into prime factors and take the shared
factors with the lowest power.
###### GCD using euclid algorithm
Is based on the principle that the gcd of two numbers does not
change if the larger number is replaced by its difference
with the smaller number. Repeat this process until the two
numbers are equal. When this occurs, these numbers are the 
gcd of the two initial ones.
###### GCD using binary
Used for computing the gcd of two nonnegative numbers.
Uses simpler arithmetic operations than the Euclid algorithm, 
it replaces division with arithmetic shifts, comparisons and 
subtraction.
